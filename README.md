# Python Practice Repository

This is a practice repository where I develop Python projects and experiments on various topics. The goal is to improve my Python skills and explore different areas of programming.

Feel free to browse through the code and provide any feedback or suggestions.


## Setup Instructions

Before you start coding, you need to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies using Poetry.

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
    - On macOS and Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3. **Install dependencies with Poetry:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

Now you are ready to start coding!
